Hello Scott, Adam, and Jas. You all need to add one paragraph of text to this file, and add a new file to the project.

Hey,

When I first went to github to make my changes, I realized that I had to learn a few things.

The first was that despite it's name, a pull request means that you want your code to be reviewed and added to the repo
the next was that the git clone button on github wasn't where it used to be, so I ended up using the terminal to clone
a helpful resource was https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/ The other things 
I learned were what forking meant, and how to make your own branch, and more importantly, why you want to make your own branch
Thats all I have learned so far.
