Hey guys,

I thought I would add a text file explaining what I did this last week

**********************************************************************

Most of my work was using AWS to host my portfolio website

At the end of it, I was able to host my site and make it public

I plan on updating the styling during my free time this week bc the 
default styling for my assignments looks really bad in my opinion

I was using something called apache which is software that lets
you make your server, it was a little complicated and I dont
truly understand it, but I learned a few things

Here is my DNS if you want to check out my portfolio website:

ec2-18-222-196-24.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com 


^ Portfolio looks great. AdamMenker.com is available, you could buy it, and then point there.
